#A distribution to be projected. Give the configuration tabstob probablity, e.g
#00	0.25
#11	0.75
## These numbers should sum up to one

#Enclose each set in paranthesis.
#Different models can be given at the same time, seperate them with ";"

#If this variable is empty it is equivalent to Hypergraph=a1;a2;...;aN

## Shall we print the result only and be silent otherwise ??
## If this is set to true then the output will be I1 I2 I3, separated by ResultSep
## Note that this only works if "Hypergraph" is empty, i.e. we are working with the
## uniform interactions.
