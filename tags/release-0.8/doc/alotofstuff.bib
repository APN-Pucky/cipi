The aim of this book is to provide a self-contained account of probabilistic analysis of these approaches. The book includes a discussion of distance measures, nonparametric methods based on kernels or nearest neighbors, Vapnik-Chervonenkis theory, epsilon entropy, parametric classification, error estimation, free classifiers, and neural networks. Wherever possible, distribution-free properties and inequalities are derived. A substantial portion of the results or the analysis is new. Over 430 problems and exercises complement the material.}",
